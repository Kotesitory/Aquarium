# Aquarium

Aquarium is a small underwater exploration game. The game as well as the experience of building it is and exploration. I am figuring out Unity as well as playing with Virtual reality for the first time. The game is based under the sea surface and you can look around and explore. This is intended to be a small Android game for the [Google Cardboard](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/) platform. I use the Google VR SDK for Unity for the camera projections and gyroscopic inputs. This is a very early version and the only things I have done up until now is the camera and whole VR SDK setup and the building environment. I also created some crude terain and textured it, along with some post processing which is suppose to look like you are under water. I experimented with Unity's particle system to create bubbles and imported some fish assets to enrich the experience. Below is a short preview of the current version of the current version. The app can be installed by downloading and installing the `.apk` file [here](project_assets/project.apk). To install the app you must allow installs outside of the google play store in your phone settings.
